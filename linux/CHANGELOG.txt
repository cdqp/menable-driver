Linux Driver Changelog
======================

COMPATIBILITY NOTICE FOR LINUX KERNELS 4.5 OR NEWER:
The Linux Kernel starting with version 4.5 allows a stricter management of
PCI resources via setting CONFIG_IO_STRICT_DEVMEM.
Basler Frame Grabber SDK versions (formerly known as Silicon Software Runtime) 
older than 5.8 will not work when this setting is enabled. This is a known issue
on some Linux distributions. To work-around this issue, please boot the 
linux kernel with option iomem=relaxed, or recompile the kernel with CONFIG_IO_STRICT_DEVMEM=n.

COMPATIBILITY NOTICE FOR UEFI SECURE BOOT:
If you install Linux on an UEFI machine using the Secure Boot option enabled
in the UEFI settings, drivers might need to be signed. Currently, the
Basler Linux driver does not support signing during the build
process. Signing requires for the user to create a certificate, sign the
driver using the certificate and install the certificate into the UEFI
certificate store. There are several how-tos to be found online, if you
want to sign the driver yourself. The easiest work-around however is to
disable the UEFI Secure Boot feature in your mainboard settings.

NOTICE ON INSTALL-TIME ERROR MESSAGES:
When you install the driver on modern Linux distributions you may ancounter
error messages referring to driver signing. You can safely ignore those
error messages if the UEFI Secure Boot feature is disabled in your mainboard
settings.

Version 5.5.0
-------------
- Support for new frame grabber iF-CXP12-P

Version 5.4.0
-------------
- Driver can be compiled for Kernel > 6.3.0
- Support for new frame grabber iF-CXP12-Q
- Removed support for me4 and me5 ironman
- me6: Applet check for stream id configurability now uses a blacklist, so that newer boards are implicitly
       considered to provide this feature unless it is added to the blacklist.

Version 5.3.0
-------------
- Harmonized DMA state machine with windows as far as possible
- Added error handling in case starting the DMA engine fails
- Fixed stopping the DMA engine when acquisition was stopped due to autostop

- me5: Fixed a potential deadlock if reconfiguration failed prior to driver unload
- me5: Minor fixes and improvements in reconfiguration procedure

Version 5.2.0
-------------
- Compilable with Kernel >= 5.19
- Allow larger image buffers
- Fixed issue which caused wrong setting for FG_DIGIO_INPUT when configuring GPIO

Version 5.0.0
-------------
- Revision 86269
- Changed company name in copyright notices to Basler AG

- Fixed CXP transceiver configuration

Version 4.6.0
-------------
- Revision 85036

Version 4.2.6-1
---------------
- Revision 76107
- BUG 8979: The board name used in dmesg log output by the driver is wrong; fixed

Version 4.2.6
-------------
- Revision 73485

Version 4.2.5
-------------
- Revision 72779
- Added support for high resolution timers
- BUG 6446: When buffers were over-allocated, the early termination of the DMA transfer could lead to corrupted images; fixed
- Use killable waits instead of interruptible to prevent non-fatal signals from interrupting (ctrl-z, forking, etc.)
- DMA timeout set via FG_TIMEOUT was limited to (INT_MAX-1)/1000 seconds (~25 days); fixed
- The maximum value for FG_TIMEOUT, 2147483646, is used for no DMA timeout
- Writing to mapped DMA buffers while the process uses fork() could lead to permanent damage to DMA transfers; fixed
- Sometimes adding memory buffers would fail with FG_INTERNAL_ERROR; fixed
