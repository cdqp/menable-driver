--- Installing the microEnable Linux driver ---

COMPATIBILITY NOTICE FOR LINUX KERNELS 4.5 OR NEWER:
The Linux Kernel starting with version 4.5 allows a stricter management of
PCI resources via setting CONFIG_IO_STRICT_DEVMEM.
The current Silicon Software Runtime will not work when this setting is
enabled. This is a known issue on some Linux distributions. To work-around
this issue, please boot the linux kernel with option iomem=relaxed, or
recompile the kernel with CONFIG_IO_STRICT_DEVMEM=n.

COMPATIBILITY NOTICE FOR UEFI SECURE BOOT:
If you install Linux on an UEFI machine using the Secure Boot option enabled
in the UEFI settings, drivers might need to be signed. Currently, the
Silicon Software Linux driver does not support signing during the build
process. Signing requires for the user to create a certificate, sign the
driver using the certificate and install the certificate into the UEFI
certificate store. There are several how-tos to be found online, if you
want to sign the driver yourself. The easiest work-around however is to
disable the UEFI Secure Boot feature in your mainboard settings.

NOTICE ON INSTALL-TIME ERROR MESSAGES:
When you install the driver on modern Linux distributions you may ancounter
error messages referring to driver signing. You can safely ignore those
error messages if the UEFI Secure Boot feature is disabled in your mainboard
settings.

All commands in this documentation should be run as an ordinary user.
Whenever administrative privileges are required it will be stated
explicitly.


= Prerequisites =

These installation instructions are written for and tested on Ubuntu 16.04
LTS. They will work mostly the same on other versions of Ubuntu and Linux
distributions based on Debian, including Debian Linux itself. At the end of
this document you will find notes to help you install the driver if you run
into problems when using other Linux distributions.

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and newer versions come with all prerequisites needed to
compile and install the driver in the default installation.

Please make sure that the system is up-to-date.
If the kernel is updated at a later point, you will have to re-build and
install the driver again. You can manually update the system by opening a
terminal and entering the commands

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

As of version 4.1.8 of the driver, support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2
was added.

To be able to compile and install the driver, please make sure you select the
Development Tools package when installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2.

Please make sure that the system is up-to-date.
If the kernel is updated at a later point, you will have to re-build and
install the driver again.


= Unpacking the driver sources =

To unpack the driver sources either double-click the file 
menable_linuxdrv_src_5.0.0.tar.bz2 and select "Extract" in the Archive
Manager, or open a terminal, go to the directory where you want to unpack the
sources and enter the command

	tar xzvf menable_linuxdrv_src_5.0.0.tar.bz2


= Building and installing the driver =

To build and install the driver, you need to open a terminal and go to the
directory where you unpacked the driver sources. Then you simply enter the
commands

	cd linux
	make && sudo make install

and provide your password when asked. All necessary files will be built and
installed.

Note: You may encounter error messages during install referring to driver
signing starting with "SSL error" or "sign-file". These messages can be safely
ignored if the UEFI Secure Boot feature is disabled in your mainboard settings.

To load the driver enter the command

	sudo modprobe menable

You can check if the driver was loaded correctly and all microEnable boards
were found by entering the command

	dmesg | grep menable

At this point the driver should now load automatically when you have to reboot
the computer.


= Preparing your user's account =

Once the driver is loaded, you can access the microEnable boards only with
administrative privileges. To enable your user's account to use the devices,
you need to add them to the group "video". You can do so by opening a terminal
and entering the command (replace <username> with the name of your user's
account)

	sudo usermod -aG video <username>

You have to logout and re-login to apply the changes in group membership.
Now you should be able to fully use the microEnable boards from your user's
account.

Note: On some Linux distributions usermod seems to be broken. See the
troubleshooting section for more information.


= Uninstalling =

If you want to uninstall the driver completely, you simply enter the following
commands in a terminal

	sudo rmmod menable.ko
	sudo rm /etc/udev/rules.d/10-siso.rules
	sudo rm /sbin/men_path_id /sbin/men_uiq
	sudo rm `find /lib/modules -name menable.ko`

Please note that ` above must be a backtick, usually entered as accent grave.
You can simply enter the find command seperately, note the path of menable.ko
and then call sudo rm with that path.


= Troubleshooting =

* When the kernel is updated, you have to re-build the driver module and
  install it again. You can do this by opening a terminal and entering the
  commands

	make clean
	make && sudo make install

* On some Linux distributions usermod seems to be broken. You can edit the
  file /etc/group using the following command

    sudo vi /etc/group

  look for the line specifying the video group and add your account (replace
  <username> with the name of your user's account). In vi you have to type "i"
  first to edit the file you loaded.

    video:x:44:<username>
    
  Multiple accounts can be added by putting them at the end of the line
  separated with "," (but do not add any spaces). You can save the file and
  exit from vi by first pressing <ESC> and then typing ":wq".

* On some Linux distributions you will have to install some prerequisites
  before you can build kernel modules. Since there are multiple standards for
  package management and even more for naming packages, this document can only
  provide general suggestions.
  Basically, what you need is a working C compiler and the kernel build
  environment, usually referred to as either linux headers, kernel headers, or
  kernel source.
  You can test for a working C compiler by opening a terminal and entering the
  command

	gcc -v

  This should give you the version of gcc if it is installed, or an error
  message saying that the command could not be found if it is not installed.
  The kernel build environment can usually be found through a link in the
  kernel directory in /lib/modules/. Entering the command

	ls -l /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build

  should show you the directory or link. If you get an error message, saying
  that the file or directory could not be found, you need to install the
  kernel build environment first.
  Most times, a simple search on the internet on "how do I compile a kernel
  module on <Linux distribution>" will give you a starting point.
  Read the documentation for your Linux distribution and look up package
  management. Using the package manager search for packages called gcc,
  build-essential, linux-headers, kernel-headers, linux-source, or
  kernel-source.

* If "make" fails to build the driver module then you either have a kernel
  which is too old, or too new, or you need to install prerequisites for
  building kernel modules (see above).
  Please note that kernels older than version 2.6.23 will not be supported.
  You can find the kernel version by opening a terminal and entering the
  command

	uname -r

  If you have a kernel that is newer than version 2.6.23 but the build fails,
  please contact our support and include in the email the error messages in
  the output of the make command, the name and version of your Linux
  distribution (e.g. Fedora 11, openSuse 11.4) and the output of the command

	uname -a

* Depending on the distribution you use, you either have to use "sudo" and
  enter the user's password, or "su -" and enter the root password to gain
  administrative privileges. On distributions with root account and no sudo
  policy, you build and install the driver by entering the commands

	make
	su -
		[you are asked for the root password]
	make install
	exit

  All other commands that were preceeded with "sudo" in the instructions above
  have to be entered accordingly (replace <command> with the actual command
  after "sudo")

	su -
		[you are asked for the root password]
	<command>
	exit

* If the driver was built correctly but you cannot "modprobe" it, you can try
  to manually load it by going to the directory where you built it and
  entering the command

	sudo insmod ./menable.ko

  If the driver still can't be loaded, maybe your kernel build environment
  does not match the running kernel.

* If the driver is not loaded automatically after rebooting the computer, you
  may need to add the driver to a list of modules that should be loaded at
  startup, or the module dependency database is broken, or the driver is not
  installed correctly. This is completely dependant on the Linux distribution
  that is used.

* On some Linux distributions the group "video" might not exist. You might
  need to use addgroup, or groupadd, or some similar program to add the group
  to your system. The group can be added manually to the file /etc/group. Be
  careful, however, when editing system files by hand, as you might break
  things.

* If your distribution does not use udev, or the udev configuration works
  substantially different than adding scripts to /etc/udev/rules.d/, you
  need to figure out how to integrate loading of the driver, changing the
  rights and ownership of the device nodes /dev/menable*, and applying the
  configuration scripts men_path_id and men_uiq after installation of the
  sysfs device interfaces.
